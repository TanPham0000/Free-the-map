	<p>I carry many lives within me. Bream, perch, eel, roach, zander and dace move through my waters, and even the majestic sturgeon is finding its way back.</p>
	<p>They travel through all of me, drifting from my wide mouth to my narrow stretches, slipping into side branches like the Kromme Rijn to spawn and migrate, with locks acting as vital gateways along the way.</p>
